== Workshop Pre-requisites

=== Setting up the UI and Terminal

*The workshop was designed and tested on the Chrome browser and it is advised to avoid issues that this browser be used whenever possible*

Open the browser and navigate to the console url {webConsoleUrl}[{webConsoleUrl}, window="_blank"]

Logon using the user provided by the course administrator (userx where x is a unique number for your session)

When logged on you will be presented with a screen listing the projects, of which there are currently none

Hit 'Create Project'

For 'Name' enter sandboxx, where x is your unique number

For the duration of the advanced workshop you will be working in this project

'Display Name' and 'Description' are optional labels

Once the project has been created (you will be given a dashboard) change the mode of the UI from Administrator to Developer by clicking on the top left of the UI where it says 'Administrator' and selecting 'Developer'

On the Topology page it will state 'No workloads found' - Click on 'Container Image'

In 'Image Name' enter 'quay.io/ilawson/devex4'

Click on the search icon to the right of the text box

Leave everything else as default and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Hit 'Create'

Wait for the ring around the application icon to change to dark blue - this indicates the application has been started

In the topology page click on the 'Show URL' icon as shown below

This will open another tab with a command line in it - this is your terminal for the duration of the advanced workshop

Switch back to the UI and click on the userx displayed at the top right and select 'Copy Login Command' as shown below

In the new tab that appears login with your userx (unique number instead of x) and password 'openshift'

Click on 'Display Token'

Copy the command given for 'Log in with this token' - this may require using the browser 'copy' command after highlighting the command

Close this tab and switch to the terminal tab - if you have closed the terminal tab go back to the UI and select the 'Show URL' from the topology view in the Developer UI

Paste and execute the command

Press 'y' to use insecure connections

The terminal should now be logged on - to check it try

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc version
----

The terminal should display your user for the first command and the client and Kubernetes versions for the second command

Finally, for use in the examples we will require some source material from the git repo for this workshop. To set this up type the following:

[source]
----
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/utherp0/workshop4
ls -alR
----

These files are the source of the Workshop and all the required local material for the course.
