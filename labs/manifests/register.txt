Lab Register
------------

When adding/committing a lab to the labs/src please add it here so it can be referenced in the manifest.

Format is:
(line separated from other entries)
Identifier (the filename without the .asciidoc, i.e. quay)
Version tested against (OCP version required, for screenshot compliance, i.e. 4.3)
Overview (textual overview detailing the lab, be as verbose as you like)
