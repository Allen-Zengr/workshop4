== OpenShift Pipelines - Tekton

=== Introduction

*For many years teams have created automation pipelines to build, unit test, analyse and deploy applications in a variety of toolchains. Some such toolchains (Jenkins for one) predate the popularisation of containers and are now being questioned for their fit for the delivery of cloud native applications. While we are at pains not to criticise jenkins (we are big users and fans) there is scope to look at alternative approaches for cloud native applications.*

*OpenShift Pipelines are based on the Tekton open source project and they provide a Kubernetes style, resource based approach to the construction of pipelines. Tasks are defined as small units of operations (typically 10 to 15 lines of YAML) and such tasks are grouped together into taskruns or pipelines for execution*.

*A new commmand line exists for the execution of Tekton commands and a graphical user interface can be added to the cluster to provide a simple way to run tasks and to observe running or completed tasks.*

The Tekton project can be found here : https://tekton.dev/

Further documentation on the specifics of Tekton can be found on the github site here : https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline

==== Simple task creation and execution

*In the simplest format a task can be executed by a taskrun object*.
